# A note to the reader

This repository is the culmination of the work collected while teaching the course *Real Analysis (M331)* at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. For every class I taught at UH manoa, I created a website for them. The link to the M331 course website is [https://mathopo.ca/courses-website/math-331/math-331](https://mathopo.ca/courses-website/math-331/math-331).
